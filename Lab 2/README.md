# Lab 2

Part 1 of this lab is creating a sequence detector that can detect the sequence "10X01". Part 2 of this lab is creating a vending machine. This vending machine sells phone cases ($10) and wireless earbuds ($15). Additionally, the vending machine only takes $5, $10, $20, and $50 bills, and returns change - if any - after the product is dispensed. Finally, this vending machine, when reset, resets the entire system.
