# Lab 2

Part 1 of this lab is creating a sequence detector that can detect the sequence "10X01". Part 2 of this lab is creating a vending machine. This vending machine sells phone cases ($10) and wireless earbuds ($15) and only takes $5, $10, $20, and $50 bills. It dispenses the product after the money has been input - specifically after the input when no more money is being inserted and returns change - if any - with the product being dispensed.
